## 💌 Introduction

Hi task-having individuals (aka everyone),

My name is Cognition (call me Coggy)!
I am a scientific task planner, made with love from Tammy Pham and her own productivity struggles, to help you plan things using *pyschology oooo...*. 

My main occupation is sorting and organizing tasks for you in the most cognitively optimal way using my A.I. big brain magic (and science, of course) 🧠✨ – so that you can focus on actually doing your tasks rather than stressing about how to balance them all.

The goal is not to maximize productivity in a singular session, but to optimize your well-being and sustainable focus in the bigger picture.

## 💡 Key Features

- 🧠 **Brain-conscious design**: Recommends a structured task schedule, which is balanced by brain regions used for each activity. Built with guidance from a PhD Clinical Psychologist, the app logic is concrete and scientific.
- ✨ **Task Classification via NLP**: Uses Natural Language Processing to tag tasks by brain region(s) used (e.g., Hippocampus, Frontal Lobe, etc. ) to be organized accordingly.
- 🧪 **Adaptive Planning**: Customizes recommendations based on user’s cognitive profile from a brief initial assessment.
- 📊 **Insightful Data**: Provides informative weekly overviews of cognitive patterns for user's self-awareness.
- 🧍‍♀️ **Human-Centered Design**: User-friendly UI that is accessible for everyone.

## 📦 Tech Stack 
- Python, spaCy, NLTK for NLP Tasks
- React for UI (MVP in planning)
- Git, GitHub Issues for project planning

## 📂 Repo Structure (All in progress)

- `backend/`: Core logic and classifiers (in progress)
- `notebooks/`: Prototypes, experiments, and NLP tests
- `data/`: Sample task inputs (for internal use)
- `docs/`: Architecture diagrams, planning notes

## 🔭 Status Updates
- May 2, 2025: The idea was officialy ideated! 
- May 7, 2025: Tammy wrote her first SpaCy code chunk while procrastinating on her Discrete Math assignment.
- May 12, 2025: Compiled necessary topics and tools for the app development.
- May 13, 2025: Tammy and PhD Psychologist discuss dynamically adjusting algorithm to fit user's cognitive profile through a screening.
- May 15, 2025: Currently in MVP development phase. Back-end logic and task classification is being messily prototyped. Front-end samples are underway (React, maybe Streamlit). 

## 📅 Planned Timeline

- May–June 2025: Core classification & intake logic
- July 2025: UI & front-end prototype
- August 2025: MVP testing & feedback loop

## 🤝 Contribution Opportunities

This is a solo project with room for research collaboration, testing, and or UI contributions. If this sounds at all intriguing to you, feel free to reach out to me!
